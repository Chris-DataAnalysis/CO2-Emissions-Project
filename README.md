# Global CO₂ Emissions Analysis

This project analyzes global CO₂ emissions over the last decade, focusing on trends, fuel type contributions, and country-level shifts. The data was explored using SQL for querying, cleaned and structured appropriately, and visualized in Tableau to uncover meaningful insights about emission sources and patterns. The goal was to present a clear and compelling picture of how emissions have evolved over time and where the most significant changes are occurring.

# Project Objectives
Analyse global CO₂ emissions trends from 2013 to 2023

Identify top CO₂-emitting countries and their primary fuel sources

Compare changes in emissions at the country level over a 10-year period

Communicate findings effectively through interactive Tableau dashboards

# Skills Demonstrated
Data cleaning and preparation using SQL (handling NULLs, standardising values, filtering out invalid rows)

Exploratory data analysis through structured SQL queries and aggregations

Data visualisation using Tableau (bar charts, line graphs, and category breakdowns)

Dashboard design focused on clarity, aesthetics, and interactivity


# Key Insights
Global CO₂ emissions have generally risen over the past decade, with a dip during 2020 likely due to the COVID-19 pandemic

Coal remains the dominant fuel source for many of the top-emitting countries

Some countries, such as the United States and Germany, have significantly reduced emissions since 2013

Others, including China and India, have seen notable increases in their emissions over the same period

The top 10 emitters contribute a substantial share of global emissions, with wide variation in their fuel type reliance
